        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychologist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kayla Pham and I am currently a second year student at the University of California, Riverside studying psychology. The reason why I am pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology as my degree is because of my past adolescent experiences. During the age of 13, I underwent depression due to the divorce of my parents. As a result, I had met with several psychologists who had not helped too much. Instead, I was blessed to have a strong support group outside of counseling which had helped me much more than counseling. This inspired me to want to become a psychologist since I want to be able to be a source of comfort for my patients or anyone struggling with a mental illness. Some patients are not able to attain a strong support group outside of counseling due to the environment they are around, and this motivated me more to become a psychologist that could be their support. I aspire to be a rock for many people to lean on and find comfort in which is why I decided to pursue the career of becoming a psychologist.<br><br>

        In recent times, I have worked two jobs in the restaurant industry. My past restaurant jobs were at Burntzilla and Burger Lounge. These work experiences have helped me develop the skills of becoming a team player along with providing exceptional customer service skills. It has also taught me that I am a hardworker who is determined to achieve any goal or hardship. Not only did these job itself teach me certain aspects about myself, but so did my employers. My employers have shaped me into the person I am today by teaching me important life lessons such as learning how to do things more efficiently or learning how to turn a bad situation into something good. They have taught me how to be a more positive person in how I view things. Although the psychology field and restaurant business are different,  I believe these skills have taught me important life lessons that I can apply to my future job as a psychologist. By learning that I am determined, I have learned that I will not fail my patients. By becoming a team player, I would hopefully make the work environment around me a positive environment. Lastly, by tending to customers needs, I have learned how to correctly communicate with people  in a polite manner. This overall improved my communication skills which I could utilize when talking to patients or their families.<br><br>

        Although I do not have much experience in the professional business of psychology yet, I feel that I am more than qualified to achieve my goal of becoming a psychologist. I am charismatic, non-judging, understanding, determined, and most importantly a hard worker. As someone who learns through her experiences and resources, I can only continue to strengthen my abilities and use them as my assets in my journey to pursue psychology.  I believe that these traits will enable me to become a successful psychology in the near future.
